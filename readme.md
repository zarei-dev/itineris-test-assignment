[![Itineris Test Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](#readme-top)

This is a WordPress theme built with TailwindCSS and Composer support. The theme utilizes the WordPress block editor to create the layout, and makes use of the following technologies:
- [x] TailwindCSS
- [x] PHP 7+
- [ ] ~~Advanced Custom Fields (ACF)~~ (not used)
- [ ] ~~WordPress Command Line Interface (WP CLI)~~ (not used)
- [x] Webpack
- [x] ES6/Typescript
- [x] Composer
- [x] Gutenberg block for first section
- [x] Object-oriented code 
- [x] ~~Automated tests~~ (not used)

### How to use
1. install the theme by uploading the theme to your WordPress installation.
open a terminal and navigate to the theme folder and run the following commands:
```sh
composer install
npm install
npm run build
```

2. activate the theme
3. Import [xml data](https://github.com/zarei-dev/itineris-test-assignment/blob/TASK_FILES/itineristest.WordPress.2023-01-16.xml) to wordpress using WP Dashboard > Tools > Import or WP_CLI.
4. Done :)

### Additional notes
- I decided to not use ACF and WP CLI because I think they are not necessary for this project. also I didn't use automated tests because there is no need for them in this project.
- I decided to not using Sage starter theme because I wanted to show my skills in building a theme from scratch. I'm familiar with Sage starter theme and I used it in my previous projects.
- This test assignment is not fully responsive. I didn't have enough time to make it responsive. I'm sorry for that.
- I was very busy in the last week because it was the last days of my cooperation with the previous company. The development of this format took much less time and its details are given below.
